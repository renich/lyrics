    # A
    Today,
    I've seen your future,
    the path that precedes you
    is one of pain.

    There is no time,
    still, there is this light
    within your shame.

    You,
    will part to the mountain.
    Your nature deceives you...
    will you betray yourself?

    Your soul will be tested
    and, become relentless
    or meet it's end.

    # B
    Have patience,
    the Twins will assist you
    and help with the burden laid
    upon yourself.

    Father?
    I came to be tested.
    I'm here to reject
    what I have become.

    # A
    You're back?
    The legend has waken!
    You have overcome yourself
    and survived.

    The conquest of darkness
    has gained you this blinding
    light.

    # B
    Go now!
    The moment awaits you!
    You're one with the dream;
    unsullied and bright!

    Moonwhale,
    take him to the steel land,
    and sally to battle once and for all.

    Crystals,
    the seal has been broken,
    deliver the unspoken will of the moon.

    Brother,
    I finally found you.
    ... and went to fulfill his righteous divide.
