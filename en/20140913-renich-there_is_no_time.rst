    # A
    Today,
    I've seen the future,
    the path that precedes you,
    is one of pain.

    There is no time,
    still, there is this light,
    within your shame

    You,
    Will part to the mountain,
    your nature deceives you...
    Will you betray yourself?

    Your soul will be tested,
    and become relentless,
    or meet it's end.

    # B
    Patience,
    The Twins will assist you,
    and help with the burden laid,
    upon yourself.

    Father?
    I've come to be tested.
    I'm here to reject,
    what I have become.

    # A
    You're back?
    I cannot believe it,
    You have overcome yourself,
    and survived.

    The conquest of darkness,
    has gained you this blinding,
    light.

    # B
    Go now!
    The moment awaits you!
    You're one with the dream
    surprisingly bright!

    Moonwhale,
    take him to the steel land.
    Let him go and meet him once and for all.

    Battle,
    the seal has been broken,
    deliver the unspoken will of the moon.

    Brother,
    I've finally found you.
    and went to fulfill his righteous divine.
