I heard the news today,
about that radical,
that has been daring to think.

I will try to believe,
even if I'm uncertain,
that Galileo broke through...

Uuh, the earth is spinning;
he told me so...
Uuh, god has been lying
I didn't know!

This curiosity,
took me to climb a mountain
and, at the top, saw the view...

My eyes, from horizon,
I couln't take away;
that crazy man told the truth.

Uuh, the earth is spinning;
he told me so...
Uuh, god has been lying
I didn't know!
