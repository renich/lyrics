Set up a show,
never could make up your mind.
Wanted to be
shooting star, look up, so bright.

And I don't know why
you just run away and hide,
no one really cares...

Go and take a chance,
this life... there's nothing to it,
cut the crap and do it!

They made you think
that your body has most value, ah, ah ,ah.
You thought, this little mask,
it would last and last forever, not a chance... NOT A CHANCE!

In reality, all the things that really matter
are within one's self.
Try to find yourself, and just live the life remaining
introbella, just as is.

Normal is nothing,
rejoice just as you are,
flashing beauty is inside.

Free yourself
don't drag those chains that bind you.
I am here in case you need me!
