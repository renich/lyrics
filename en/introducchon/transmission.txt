Three days on travel,
haven't been sleeping.
I heard of trouble,
lightyears away.

No answer...
I begin to worry!
This little mission
ain't like the rest.

And, there I was; in some old planet.
Teleport there to take a look.
Transmission fails. No way, Jose!
Planet above is gonna fall!

I've resignated; 
no way around it.
This job will end
life in the end.

Then turned my eyes 
on siluette.
I gotta hit her;
want no regrets.

I spent my last forgiving moments
involved in sweet chit-chat and looks.
Transmission failed; no way around it.
This doesn't end until it falls!
