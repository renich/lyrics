And comes the sun,
destroys my soul and burns to ashes
The wind will take on,
my life in shatters.

Fulfilled the final ritual
you'll never follow on.

And through the tepest path
disolves me into lakes of peace.
Too black is to see is truth,
take back my karma!

Reavealed is to my eyes, I see,
the place I want to be.

I'm gonna loose you,
I have to leave,
I have to loose you,
freedom takes me.

Don't love to live... but live to love.
there is no past... no tomorrow... just now.

And passion boils,
ties up one look to dust and soil.
Life in a blast,
was never mine.

I tried to not look back... the light
won't see you anymore.

I'm gonna loose you,
I have to leave,
I want to loose you,
I will break free.

I can't just loose you,
I have to leave,
I need to loose you,
rain down on me.
