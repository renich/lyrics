lonely, in oblivion
erased and forgotten, 
cold and shivers

Not my mother, nor my brother
here to see me...
Drawn, in darkness,
to the misfits.

Living this's not living,
slowly, though this madness, I am dying.
And false sense of destiny keeps pushing under; 
bitter feelings make me wonder...

Tears of hatered falling down the sewers,
and blood boiling when I'm laughing, rules me out

This feelings will not be cast away,
this moment, forever, will not end.

Lonely, in oblivion
every day is forged from night and sorrow
Lively days are burned and crushed and burried
stinky lapses have no ending
