For today I will go
and I'll leave the door wide open... 
just for you

Everything is ok
I say to myself but everyday
something within tells me:

"You have to let go
and bring thyself to me".
It's so hard to live on...

I just need to find,
in order to survive,
a single day of happiness...

I won't let anymore
for that feeling to really exist
and come to me.

But I can't understad
the words of that voice inside of me,
and, it hurts so deeply.

"You have to let go
and bring thyself to me".
It's hard to live on...

I just need to find,
in order to survive,
a single day of happiness...

Just wake me up
when the earthquake is gone;
return to me!

I need to hang on
and find myself some hapiness;
a single day of hapiness.
