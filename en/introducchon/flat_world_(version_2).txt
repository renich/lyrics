Gosip got through today,
word says that radical,
the one that's daring to think.

I know, not, to believe,
feel the truth linger near by;
Don Galileo broke through.

Uuh, the world is turning,
and here I am.
Uuh, god's been deseiving,
oh, not again.

This curiosity,
rose me up to a mountain,
what an amusing cliche.

My eyes up to the sea,
and looked beyond my mind,
that radical told the truth!

Uuh, the world is turning,
and here I am.
Uuh, god's been deseiving,
oh, not again.
