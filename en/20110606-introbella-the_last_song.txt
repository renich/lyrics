A
Your life is done,
the end has come.

The rain will draw you down,
I told you so, I told you so.

B
Lean on me, my friend.
Come and say good bye, tonight. 

A
In me you've got
the void of thought.

Remember when your kind had crowns,
nevermind, nevermind...

B
Lean on me, my friend.
Come and see yourself, inside.

C
<solo>

B
Lean on me, my friend.
Come and say good bye, tonight.

Lean on me again.
Confort me because, you are no more.
