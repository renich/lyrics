    # A
    Hey, Taquero, give me a taquito.
    'cause, since January, I eat poquito.

    # B
    Since that, my woman, love no mo'
    as she keeps hurtin' me; damn whore!

This part has the bluessy feel of the song. It can't be a blues if I'm not suffering, right?

::

    # A
    Hey, Taquero, gimme a coke.
    Don't be an asswhole, today I'm due.

    # B
    Flip my life arround,
    like you flip that tortilla.

Trying to get more imagery about the elements of tacos. They always have soft drinks here; usually Coca-cola. It's just part of the
culture already. Also, calling him a "culero" is kind of harsh, but a very common thing to say here.

    # Bass solo

Yeah, well, the bass solo!

::

    # A
    Hey Taquero, two quesadillas,
    before, those vultures, claim my life.

    # B
    No more lamenting is what I want,
    but I've used too much habanero.

The vultures image is just to give it a sense of desperation. Usually, tacos is one of the most common dinner options for poor
people. One could call it one of their few treats.

Also, me begging for a quesadillas (in this case) is essential to the image here. They, usually, complain about beggars but few
don't give them something to eat. Taqueros are not rich people here... most of them, at least, aren't. Yet, they have big hearts.
You could come and play for a little while and they will give you dinner for sure!

I think this scene, where I beg for two quesadillas or I'll die of hunger is very representative of this.

Also, the pun is intended where I have this tragi-comic gesture of saying I don't want to lament anymore but I can't, because I just
had too much habanero chile; which is super spicy! :D

::

    # A
    Hey, Taquero, quit making puns,
    because your clients will start feelin' it.

    # B
    And, those who feel it, give 'em head,
    me, tongue and breast for later.

This is kind of hard to translate to english. First of all, taqueros are know for being very good at "albures":
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albur which, according to wikipedia's definition of "Double entendre" is pretty much the same thing:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre.

I've included both links because I think the latter is more accurate, yet, the former has the sexual thing included.

In general, this part tries to through a few "albures" at the taquero. This will make them laugh, definitely, but I fear for the
reprisal!

    # Guitar solo

Well, the guitar solo is intended to sound bluessy but jazzy. It has to have some of the blues elements, since Mexicans relate much
better to blues than to jazz. Yet, I am interested in Jazz thanks to you, man, so I am trying my best here.

::

    # A
    Hey, Taquero! I've come to kill you!
    This is a duel! Don't be a coward!

    # B
    I just so miss him; I haven't seen him!
    Don't play the ass, you have cooked my dog! (A common joke among people and taqueros. You claim the "dog" was well cooked to joke around)

    # Fight between the taquero and me

So, a common joke among people and taqueros offer dog meat. This is not just illegal, but unappreciated by all dog lovers in the
country! That said, when you want to make a pun with them, you will say something related to dogs being tasty in this side of the
country or something like that. Just a playful thing to do with them.

Also, dogs gather around taquerías here. They, usually, get fed either by the clients or the taquero. Sometimes they're kind of
annoying... anyway, drifting a bit...

The fight is supposed to be just funny.

::

    # A
    Hey, Taquero, don't complain so much.
    Hey, Taquero, don't complain so much.

    # B
    I'll... err... pay you later.
    I'll leave you this blues so y ou can remember me.

This part ends with the bill. In general, taqueros have stamps or posters in regards to this issue: people not paying their bill.

Many Mexicans ask for credit and pay up on payday. Taqueros are no exception. They will give you credit if they know you. Yet, they
have all kinds of funny prases printed everywhere in the stand, some of them like:

Hoy no fío, mañana si:
    Or "I don't grant credit today, I will tomorrow.". "Fiar" is giving credit. This makes fun of the classic: "I'll pay you
    'mañana'". So, they will grant the credit tomorrow as well.

I will grant credit to 96 year old people, accompanied with their grandfather:
    Yep, anything more impossible than that?

Do not mistake friendship with the business. I do not give credit:
    Some of them are more serious about it.

I don't give credit because this business is not mine:
    Yep, they try anything to avoid giving credit; even denying ownership.

All that said, sometimes, clients eat and then claim to have no money. This is my case in this song.

In reality, I wanted to give them this song because they deserve a song. Most of us eat tacoes and those guys, usually, have very
big hearts.

I have many stories of hardship and having, even, to play in the public buses to get some money to eat. Many times, when
the taquero saw me counting coins, they would go like: "dude, you always eat 10, don't tell me you want 3...", then, give me a plate
full of tacos and not charge me for them. They would say: "Pay me tomorrow... " and I could never get them to accept the money.

This song is my tribute to them and I appreciate you collaborating to make it a reality.
