    # A
    Your life is done,
    the end has come.

    The rain will draw you down, my love.
    I told you so, I told you so.

    # B
    Lean on me, my friend.
    Come and say good bye, tonight. 

    # A
    In me you've got
    the void of thought.

    Remember when your kind had crowns,
    nevermind, nevermind...

    # B
    Lean on me, my friend.
    Come and see selffie, inside.

    # C
    <solo>

    # B
    Lean on me, my friend.
    Come and say good bye...

    Lean on me again.
    Confort me because, you are no more.
