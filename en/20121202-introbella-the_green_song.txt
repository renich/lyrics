A
Floating all along, 
singing my home's song,
as a bird passes by...

Swing and bounce a bit,
ready for a trip,
the adventure begins...

B
Faling down,
down to earth I...
will become,
one with it and You.

A
Joining my old friends,
binding never ends,
as we slide down the stream...

Dance and join with them,
waisting no attempt,
to become what we will...

B
Flowing on,
to the sea we'll...
join once more
and become You.

C
Behold,
the stereo feelings that life
has brought upon.

We need to get along,
we'll learn to get along...

A (ending?)
There we go again,
floting back once more,
been reborn.
