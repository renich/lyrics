A
I know, you know,
there's no control.
Before, I go,
You'll dissapear.
And leave me home
where I can blead alone.

And, though,
I'll never see you through.
The ropes that bind us,
are untrue.
And we're forever
on our own.

You know I'll never forget you

B
This is the end and I will part.
The road is dark, but I'll commit.
This will not end, this never ends, 
until I'm far away.

A
Just don't forget,
my heart's so true.
You're now your own,
that's life for you.
But there's still hope,
that I will never ever see you back to me...

And I don't care...
