    # A
    I see a world coming trough.
    I see people that do care.
    I see great technology.
    I see many paths ahead.
    
    # B
    And before you look away,
    set your eyes to the edge of time.
    
    I see collaboration.
    I see determination.
    I see wisdom from the past.
    I see science's here at last.
    
    # B
    And behold...
    The horizon is near.
    
    # C
    Yeah,
    we're here to evolve,
    and bring this land some joy,
    and help the universe get built.
    
    We have power so extreme;
    whatever we can dream,
    we can create,
    we can create...
